			<h2>Learn to Code with Your Children</h2>
			<h3>(for children in Years 2 or 3 and their parents, in Princes Risborough)</h3>
			<p>The national curriculum requires even the youngest children in Key Stage 1 to understand algorithms, create and debug simple programs, to predict the behviour of computer programs, among other things. (See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/239033/PRIMARY_national_curriculum_-_Computing.pdf">the complete Key Stage 1 and 2 computing curriculum as a PDF here</a>.)</p>

			<p>Last year, I couldn't begin to do any of those things, let alone my children, but after switching careers to software development, I've learned that programming is creative, exciting, instantly rewarding - and for everyone, even a mum of two. It develops literacy and numeracy skills, teaches problem solving and logic, and encourages generosity and curiosity.</p>

			<blockquote>"The basic idea of computing is you have to get a computer to solve a problem: you have to come up with an algorithm, a set of instructions. If you can do that, it’s a hugely valuable skill."</blockquote>

			<p>Code Together will use off-screen activities to learn computer science concepts and Scratch, a visual programming language. Children must be accompanied by adults willing to learn: mums, dads, grandparents... and everyone will finish the course having built three distinct projects in pairs and teams over five or six seesions. Ideally, people will bring their own laptops, but laptops can be provided.</p>

			<p>I know I want it to be in October/November-ish time, but when exactly? Spread out over weekends, or all at once over a half term week? Sign up and take our survey. The more specific you can be and more options to can offer about your scheduling preferences, the better! When I can get a decent sized group together around the same time frame, we'll just get going.</p>
